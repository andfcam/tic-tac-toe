# Tic-tac-toe
A recreation of the noughts-and-crosses game made in week 3.

A two-player game of noughts-and-crosses. Together with rock-paper-scissors, these are the first implementations of game logic. The game looks for a winner each turn and displays a congratulatory modal after each round. The game keeps track of the score and displays whose turn it is.
